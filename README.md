- HTML / SCSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/)

## License

This is an OpenClassrooms project. The code is freely reusable, but assets (images, videos and logo) are not because they are not mine.

If you are also a student of OC, you can freely use my work as inspiration, but I advise you not to copy parts of it.
